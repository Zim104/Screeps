Hunter's Screep Code
===========================
Version 0.1



To do list
===========================

o Refine repairers to fully repair instead of repairing to the set threshold.
o Maybe combining builders with repairers (with repairing getting a priority of course).
o Dynamic creep spawning based on energy available.



History
===========================

Version 0.1
7/25/2016
---------------------------
o Tower fixed and given a heal wall mode when above 700 energy.
o Repairers set to only worry about buildings and not walls.
o Defcon countdown created to spawn emergency harvesters.
	(...probably a better way to handle that, but that's good enough for now.)
